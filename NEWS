* Master (unreleased)

** New features

- Any file type (not just PDFs) can now be associated with a citekey.

- In addition to =bog-find-citekey-file= and =bog-find-citekey-bib=,
  most functions will now prompt with set of citekeys when prefix
  argument is given.  What this list is depends on the function.

- When locating a citekey from the notes fails, functions will now
  prompt with a list of citekeys instead of giving an error.

- Bog commands are now available outside of Org buffers through
  =bog-commander=.  This is based off of =projectile-commander=.  The
  custom Bog commands for the Org agenda have been removed because
  this functionality is now available through =bog-commander=.

- New command =bog-citekey-tree-to-indirect-buffer= opens the subtree
  for a citekey in an indirect buffer.  The citekey is either taken from
  at point or selected from all heading citekeys.

- New command =bog-insert-heading-citekey= prompts with all heading
  citekeys and inserts the selected one at point.

- New command =bog-open-first-citekey-link= opens the first link found
  under the subtree of a citekey.  This is particularly useful if you
  place the main link for the study (usually a DOI link) as the first
  link in the citekey's subtree.  The citekey is either taken from at
  point or selected from all heading citekeys.

** Other changes

- =bog-goto-citekey-heading-in-buffer= and
  =bog-goto-citekey-heading-in-notes= will now widen the buffer if the
  heading is outside of the narrowed region.

- The format for citekeys is now restricted to letters, digits,
  underscores, and hyphens.

- =bog-notes-directory= has been renamed to =bog-note-directory=.

  title.

- Add agenda search commands =bog-search-notes= and
  =bog-search-notes-for-citekey=.

- Add commands =bog-sort-topic-headings-in-buffer= and
  =bog-sort-topic-headings-in-notes=.

- Read a new name if renaming to PDF that exists (instead of giving an
  error).

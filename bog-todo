#+startup: nologdone

* General

** DONE Inconsistent face highlighting

Some citekeys are not highlighed until the surrounding text is altered.

** DONE Function for getting all citekeys in notes

Perhaps use a cache file. This could be used in
`bog-search-citekey-on-web' and `bog-rename-staged-pdf-to-citekey'.

** DOC Mention useful tools

- projectile: Store the notes files in git directory and use projectile
  to manage as project.
- git annex: Store and sync associated PDF files using git annex.

** DONE Installation instructions

* Notes

** ENH Find in-text citekeys that don't have a header

** ENH Check for duplicate citekeys headings

** ENH Make bog-goto functions work when citekey is property

Currently, `bog-goto-citekey-heading-in-buffer' and
`bog-goto-citekey-heading-in-notes' only work if the citekey is stored
as a heading, not a property.

* BibTeX files

** ENH Create combined bib from a suffix glob

For documents generated from multiple files

Default could be "*.tex".

* PDF files

** DONE Generalize PDF functions in bog

Replace bog-find-citekey-pdf with bog-find-citekey-file. The extensions
that will be considered could be customized. Rebind this to "f".
bog-rename-staged-pdf-to-citekey would be
bog-rename-staged-file-to-citekey and could use the same customized
extensions (or maybe just take the extension from the original file).

** DONE Use `org-file-apps' instead of `bog-pdf-opener'

* Testing

** ENH Ability to run tests from makefile

** DONE Put some of the common setup in macros

I'm thinking mainly of temporary Org buffers.

* Release archive                                                   :ARCHIVE:

** v0.6.0
*** CANCELED Switch from obsolete `flet' to `noflet'
    - State "CANCELED"   from "ENH"        [2014-02-12 Wed 00:50] \\
      Removed `flet`, but with set up of `bog-citekey-action', a replacement
      funciton can be passed instead of using `noflet`.

*** DONE Map basename to full name for PDF rename

When more than one file in staged, completing read prompts with full
paths, which is inconvenient if using default completing read function.

*** DONE Better handling of multiple PDFs

If multiple PDFs for a citekey, complete read.

*** DONE Use a stage for new BibTeX files

Avoid filtering all bib file names.

*** DONE [#A] Make `bog-find-citekey-bib' compatible with a single BibTeX file

*** DONE Refiling for just bib notes

Redefine org refile targets.

*** DONE [#A] Allow citekeys to be properties instead of headings

*** DONE Suggest keybindings

*** DONE Describe BibTeX autokey settings for `bog-citekey-format'

*** CANCELED Citekey selection if locating fails
    - State "CANCELED"   from "ENH"        [2014-03-16 Sun 17:59] \\
      For now, I will stick to issuing an error message if no citekey is
      found, and only prompting if a prefix argument is given.

*** DONE [#A] Add README
